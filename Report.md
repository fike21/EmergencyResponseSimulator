## 🏗️ OOP Concepts Applied
| Concept        | Implementation                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Abstraction    | `EmergencyUnit` abstract base class     |
| Inheritance    | Police/Firefighter/Ambulance subclasses |
| Polymorphism   | Overridden response methods             |
| Encapsulation  | Protected properties and methods        |

## 🎯 Challenges Faced
1. **Random Incident Generation**: Ensuring fair distribution of incident types
2. **Unit Matching**: Implementing the correct unit-to-incident matching logic
3. **Score Tracking**: Maintaining state across simulation rounds

## 📚 Lessons Learned
- Practical application of polymorphism through method overriding
- Importance of clean class separation
- Effective use of abstract base classes
